IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU MUST NOT ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT AND MAY NOT USE THE SERVICES.\n\n\nIf PipelineIO makes material changes to these Terms, we will notify you by email and/or by posting a notice on our site before the changes are effective. Any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, shall be subject to the Terms of Service. Continued use of the Service after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes. You can review the most current version of the Terms of Service at any time on the Site.\n\n\nViolation of any of the terms below will result in the termination of your Account. While PipelineIO prohibits such conduct and Content on the Service, you understand and agree that PipelineIO cannot be responsible for the Content posted on the Service and you nonetheless may be exposed to such materials. You agree to use the Service at your own risk.\n\n\nA. Account Terms\n\n\n\n\nYou must be 13 years or older to use this Service.\n\n\nYou must be a human. Accounts registered by \"bots\" or other automated methods are not permitted.\n\n\nYou must provide your legal full name, a valid email address, and any other information requested in order to complete the signup process.\n\n\nYour login may only be used by one person - a single login shared by multiple people is not permitted. You may create separate logins for as many people as your plan allows.\n\n\nYou are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. PipelineIO cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.\n\n\nYou are responsible for all Content posted and activity that occurs under your account (even when Content is posted by others who have accounts under your account).\n\n\nOne person or legal entity may not maintain more than one free account.\n\n\nYou may not use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose. You must not, in the use of the Service, violate any laws in your jurisdiction (including but not limited to copyright or trademark laws).\n\n\nYou may not use this Service if you are a direct competitor, except with PipelineIO's prior written consent. You may not use or access the Service to compile data in a manner that is used or usable by a competitive product or service.\n\n\n\n\nB. Use Terms\n\n\nYou expressly understand and agree that PipelineIO shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if PipelineIO has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from your use of the Services.\n\n\nAbuse or excessively frequent requests to PipelineIO may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account's access. PipelineIO, in its sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage. PipelineIO will make a reasonable attempt via email to warn the account owner prior to suspension.\n\n\nPipelineIO reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, your access with or without notice.\n\n\nC. Payment, Refunds, Upgrading and Downgrading Terms\n\n\n\n\nYou are not required to provide a credit card number to open an account.\n\n\nOnce your free trial period has ended you will be required to enter a credit card to continue usage.\n\n\nAny usage once you enter credit card information will immediately incur a usage charge.\n\n\nPipelineIO calculates your server usage in seconds and bills you for that amount of usage at the prevailing rates displayed on our web site. We track your usage in seconds and charge you for the fraction of an hour that you used. So if you only use 5 minutes, you'll only be billed for 5 minutes. Please note that we will round each charge up to the nearest cent (so the minimum charge is 1 cent).\n\n\nRoughly once a month, we will bill you for the usage charges you have accrued over the preceding month (unless other payment terms have been arranged).\n\n\nAll fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties, excluding only United States (federal or state) taxes.\n\n\nDowngrading your Service may cause the loss of Content, features, or capacity of your Account. PipelineIO does not accept any liability for such loss.\n\n\n\n\nD. Cancellation and Termination\n\n\nYou are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. Contact help@pipeline.io for canceling your account.\n\n\nPipelineIO, in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service, or any other PipelineIO service, for any reason at any time. Such termination of the Service will result in the deactivation or deletion of your Account or your access to your Account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all Content in your Account. PipelineIO reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time\n\n\nE. Modification of the Services\n\n\nPipelineIO reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice.\n\n\nPrices of all Services, including but not limited to monthly subscription plan fees to the Service, are subject to change upon 30 days notice from us (unless you have agreed otherwise with PipelineIO).
